# Real-Time Analysis - ðŸ’¡ Examples

This folder contains example files for [tasksets definitions](tasksets) and for specific analysis types (ex. [up_rate_monotonic](up_rate_monotonic)). Each analysis type contains both some example tasksets and some config files, useful if the analysis software must be run in scripts and similar batch configurations.

### ðŸš€ run_all script

The `run_all.sh` script additionally compiles the software and runs a fixed set of analysis, both for example purposes and for general testing.

```bash
> sh run_all.sh
```
