# Multiprocessor Periodic Resource Model

[**🏠 Go back to all analyses**](../../../README.md#-available-analyses)

🚧 Under Construction 🚧

### 🔑 Preconditions

---

- Tasks are deadline constrained and sporadic.
- Each processor on the platform has the same computing capacity.
- Any job can be preempted and migrated on any core.

### 🧪 Implemented Analyses

---

- **Shin, Easwaran, Lee** (2008) [^1]
