//! The **Evaluation**, **Verification** and **Analysis Engine** for **Real-Time** applications
//! schedulability (short as *EVA-rt-Engine* or simply *EVA*) is a software created to perform
//! real-time schedulability analyses.
//! 
//! **EVA** implements a variety of *state-of-the-art* tests to assert wheter a given taskset is
//! schedulable on a given platform. Additionally, it also implements designers that search for the
//! minimum required resources to schedule the given task on the given platform and scheduling
//! approach.
//! 
//! **EVA** is distributed under the *GPL3* license, both as a standalone tool and as a Rust library
//! that can be easily integrated in other Rust-based projects.
